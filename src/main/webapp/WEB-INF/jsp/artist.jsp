                <div class="artistskit-info__item">
                    SKIT-TELZ was born and raised in the Bronx,the birthplace of Hip-Hop.He began rhyming before the age of ten after being influenced by his Brother-in law's Hip-Hop records.Some of these records included artists such as K-R-S ONE,Rakim,Big Daddy Kane & Kool G Rap to mention a few.But his inspirational encouragement came when he found out about Kriss Kross due to the fact that they were just as young as him.

                    Shortly after turning the age of fourteen he was given his name.Peers said his voice sounded like Eminem's but his lyrical content was different ,and since the opposite of M&M is Skittles, he was therefore called Skittelz.The True meaning of his name is actually an extended version of the slang word SKILZ(SKIT-TELZ).The second meaning is that "you wouldn't have the name Skittelz without SKILZ (skills) in it".Another alias he is known as is SKITTZ which is short for SKITTELZ.
                    SKITTZ  attended a school which was considered as "The worst school in the Bronx" according to news reports reflecting the number of incidents.Skittz regretably developed rebellious habits such as hanging out ,loitering and  battling fellow students while he was within the sub-par environment.The face of Skittz definetely stood out while he attended the primarily african-american/West Indian school crowded with thousands of students.Back then if you asked "who is Skittelz?", the answer would've been "the latino guy with long hair,always wearing a hat or some type of head covering that is always rapping!"

                    Skittz withstood those 4 years of battling on street corners,hallways and lunchrooms while being under constant pressure of being one of only a handful of latino mc's.This was during a time where Terror Squad had not yet risen to it's plateau and reggaeton had not acheived mainstream popularity.The young emcee felt so determined to be successful that he vowed not to cut his hair until he is a successful artist.Therefore he has been growing his long braids ever since, giving him a raised level of attention.Skittz then, utilized his hard-work,enthusiam and dedication in order to graduate, overcoming lousy grades by writing
                    poetry,songs and rhymes as extra credit for several of his instructor's classes.

                    During this period of education he had also started attending the "Hip-Hop Workshop" which was hosted by hip-hop pioneers.His love for hip-hop inspired him to continue in this educational process,learning from speakers such as Heru Shango,Pee-Wee Dance,Dj Kool Herc,etc.During this inspirational workshop he learned priceless techniques for writing, performing,etc. ,as well as learning some of the history of our hip-hop culture.

                    Skittz used his newfound knowledge in order to upgrade his lyricism and material content.He began writing in order to escape reality while embracing the life he was living.He began to renounce the typical "rap" subjects such as violence,money,etc., because he felt it has became unnappealing and cliched unless it was packaged in an imaginative manner of creativity.Moral and message were being delivered such not using the "N" word, as well editing tracks or restricting the amount of cursing unless deemed necessary for the emotional or topical statement of the record.The strongpoint became the topics and messages.He became diverse with subjects rather than glorifying the shooting,stabbing and jails. This due in part to the fact that people getting shot,stabbed and encarcerated are his own people within the community.

                    After high school, the young emcee decided to further his education at the institute of audio research located in new york city.Developing more skills in courses involving recording engineering,post-production and the business of music.The experienced hip-hop artist learned info on the crafts of other types of music ranging from rock to techno.In 2007, he was eventually nominated in through the school along with his instructor for an Audio Engineering Society Award for work done in their recording workshop.Ironically , this hip-hop emcee had been nominated for a mix which was performed by a band and placed in the rock/pop category.

                    During that year Skittz had also started an internship in the A&R/Promotion department for Sony/Bmg at Columbia Records.He learned first hand about how the industry actually works and what is necessary to be successful in this field.

                    Skittelz was first discovered in 2003 by a relative of an A&R from J records.Skittz was rapping while inside of a bootleg cd shop while an instumental cd was playing.He began to freestyle throughout the entire cd drawing attention when approached byToya Mack, the sister of label executive Kelly Mack.He began to create different freestyle songs on the spot.Toya was so impressed that she called A&R Kelly Mack, and the rest was history.

                    Since that point, skittz has worked under the supervision of Kelly ,as well as other experienced individuals within the industry. Within this time Skittz has began to establish his credentials by performing and appearing at numerous events including television,internet radio and live shows.Skittz has also worked  closely with upcoming filmakers & producers while acting in independant films.Networking has been a huge strongpoint which attributes to skittelz success.

                    His main goal musically was to bring the essence of hip-hop's past at the present in order to create the future of hip-hop.Along with a personal objective to bring hip-hop back to where it was born at.
